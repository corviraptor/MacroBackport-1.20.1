# MacroBackport-1.20.1

Backports Function Macros and multi-line commands to 1.20.1 from 1.20.2.

The code is basically directly ripped from 1.20.2 with very little modifications to the actual function implementations. `@Overwrite` is used quite a bit. It's not pretty, but this should never have to be updated to a future version of Minecraft for reasons that should be obvious.
